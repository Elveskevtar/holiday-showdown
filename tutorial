This is the tutorial.
Holiday Showdown is a two to four player turn based game where each player attempts to reach
150 cookies by upgrading their holiday themed store. On each player's turn they have two
options: perform an action or perform an upgrade. There are two types of actions that you can
perform: advertisment and sabotage. To advertise, just say 'advertise'. To sabotage, say
'sabotage' followed by the target's name. There are three types of upgrades you can perform:
item, store, and advertisment upgrades. Item upgrades give you more cookies per turn while
store and advertisment upgrades help with your multiplier which adds to your cookies at the
end of each round. More statistics about upgrade levels and multipliers can be found in the
skill description on the Alexa app. Also, you may query about how many cookies you have, how
much it costs to upgrade, or what your current upgrade levels are during any of your turns.
